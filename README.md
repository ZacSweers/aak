AAK (Auto-Annotation-Kotlin)
============================

## ðŸš§ Under construction ðŸš§ ##

An annotation processor to generate `Proxy`-based helper methods for creating Kotlin annotations at
runtime. Based on Google's (TODO link) AutoAnnotation processor for Java.

### Example usage

Create a function annotated with `@AutoAnnotation` that returns the desired annotation type. A function
with the `aak_` prefix + any class names + the function name will be generated with all the annotation 
values as parameters.

```kotlin
annotation class Named(val name: String)

object Names {
  @AutoAnnotation fun nameAnnotation(name: String): Named {
    return aak_names_nameAnnotation(name)
  }
}
```

Will generate a function like this:

```kotlin
fun aak_names_nameAnnotation(name: String): Named {
  val handler = InvocationHandler { _, method, _ ->
    when (val methodName = method.name) {
        "name" -> name
        "toString" -> "AakProxy_Names#nameAnnotation"
        "hashCode" -> 0
        "equals" -> false
        else -> error("Unrecognized method call: $methodName")
    }
  }
  return Proxy.newProxyInstance(Named::class.java.classLoader, arrayOf(Named::class.java), handler)
      as Named
}
```

### TODO

- Extract core artifact for reuse in other annotation processors.
- Publish snapshots + first release.
- Allow annotating annotations directly to generate helper methods for them.
